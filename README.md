This project aims to analyze vehicle warranty data to improve the quality of parts, predict potential failures, determine the best course of action for defective parts,
and enhance customer retention. We utilize historical warranty claims data, customer feedback, and dealer performance metrics to generate actionable insights for the company.


Objectives
Monthly Reporting of Dealers and Defective Parts: Identify top ten dealers processing extended warranty claims and the most frequently reported defective parts.
Predictive Analysis of Part Failures: Analyze historical data to forecast parts likely to fail based on vehicle age, mileage, and location.
Repair vs. Replace Decision Model: Develop a binary classification model to decide whether a defective part should be repaired or replaced.
Customer Retention Analysis: Evaluate dealer performance and customer satisfaction to inform regulatory decisions and promotional strategies.


Methodology
1. Data Collection
Warranty Claims Data: Collected from the company’s database, including details about claims, parts, dealers, and customer feedback.
Vehicle Data: Information about vehicle age, mileage, and location.
Dealer Performance Data: Metrics on sales, claim processing, and customer interactions.

2. Data Analysis and Visualization
   
Top Dealers and Defective Parts:
Utilize libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib for visual representation of the data.
Generate reports listing the top ten dealers and the most frequently reported defective parts.

Predictive Modeling:
Use historical claim data to train predictive models using algorithms like Random Forest and Decision Trees.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

3. Decision-Making Model for Defective Parts
Model Development:
Create a binary classification model to classify defective parts as either repairable or replaceable.
Train and validate the model using the historical claim data.

4. Customer Retention Model
Feedback Analysis:
Analyze customer feedback to gauge satisfaction levels.
Assess churn rates and customer preferences for various dealers.

Understanding failure patterns can inform manufacturing decisions, helping to maintain stock of critical parts.

3. Repair vs. Replace Decision Model

Model Accuracy: Model Accuracy and Performance Metrics
Insights:
Provides a clear framework for handling defective parts, optimizing repair/replacement costs and improving customer satisfaction.

4. Customer Retention Model
Retention Insights:
Identifies dealers requiring support and areas where customer satisfaction is low.
Recommendations for promotions or changes in dealer representation based on performance.

Recommendations

Improvement Initiatives:
Focus on training for underperforming dealers.
Consider quality control enhancements for frequently defective parts.
Predictive Maintenance:
Implement inventory management strategies based on predictive failure models to ensure availability of parts.
Customer Engagement:
Enhance communication with customers regarding warranties and dealer performance to improve satisfaction and retention.

Conclusion
The project successfully identifies critical insights from warranty data, facilitating improved decision-making regarding parts management, dealer performance,
and customer retention.Ongoing monitoring and adaptation of strategies based on these insights will further enhance the company’s service quality and customer satisfaction.
